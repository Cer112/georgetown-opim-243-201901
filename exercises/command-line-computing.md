# Command-line Computing Exercise

Before we start learning about Python or software development, we need to achieve a basic level of familiarity with the command-line. Throughout the semester, we will be using the command-line to navigate and manage our computer's filesystem. We'll also be using it to execute Python scripts and other command-line utilities (CLIs).
